Chapter 1 Introduction

Installing and first steps

	To install unity type in google unity download archive. Then download the version you want to install. Version 4 uses monodevelop as IDE. Version 5 uses Visual Studio!

	After installation click the Unity icon if you created it in desktop else find it. If you open unity it might open your last working project. You can create a new project from top left in unity environement or open a folder with the project.

	The layout changes top right at the button right of the layers. To go to default just chnage it to default. To create a script right click in assets and then create a new C# script. The script created are located in Assets folder.

	For versions 4 double click will open MonoDevelop. You don't edit scripts  in Unity directly you edit them in the IDE. To save something right up left in MonoDevelop Save or Save All and then you will see changes in unity also.

	To delete a script just right click and then Delete in Unity.

What you see in the editor

	Open file Unity_Editor.jpg to see what' s going on.
1. Unity, scene name, name of game, web player means it runs as Web Player
2. To play the scene or the game press Play pause to pause and pay again to stop it
3. The game runs at Game pane/Window as you see
4. To maximize screen when you press play
5. The difference between these two is the one is that you see the objects you have in the scene and the Game tab is how it looks when you play it
Paymode tint Note: When we press the play button the screen becomes a little grey which means changes we make in the game are not persistent. They are not going to be saved.
Change play mode tint color : Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Colors -> Playmode Tint
To create a new project go to :  File -> New Project
You must select where you want to be created and if it's gonna be 2D or 3D
To create an scene as shown in first_scene.jpg Go to top right and see the options you have like New Scene, Open Scene, Save Scene, Save as Scene
Note: To move a pane/window in the editor just click on it and drag and drop it around and place it where you want
6. These icons let you do different things when you are on a scene (shortcuts q,w,e,r,t)
First mode moves the entire area/scene
Second mode lets you move obejcts around
Third mode rotates
Forth mode scales
Fifth mode for UI elements the user interface


Chapter 2 Saving and Closing

To create a script right click in assets and the Create-> C# Script as shown in monodevelop_ide.jpg
It has been created in our folder and you can check by right clicking on it Show in Explorer(Windows)
Then double click on it and MonoDevelop IDE will open
For the options Go to : Tools -> Options
Then find behavior and set Indentation Mode to Automatic rather than Smart
You can see that lines are numbered in our editor
To indent or oudent a line Ctlr + Alt + End or  Ctlr + Alt + Home
Alt  +  right or left arrrow shifts between words
You can see all shortcuts in Tools -> Options -> KeyBindings
As you see in monodevelop_saving_project.jpg if a project has a star or a x means it hasn't been saved. To save ctlr + s or left up in file save.
Note: To rename a scene in unity editor single click in the scene's name. To save check unity_saves.jpg. It saves automatically when you exit unity.
After saving you can move your folder anywhere you want

Chapter 4 Number Wizard Game

Printing to the console check console.jpg
To delete the camera select the camera right click and the delete
To have a script run we need an empty Game Object to be attached to as you can see in add_component.jpg
To create a folder wirght click in assets -> Create Folder and name it scripts so you can have scripts in it
The method Start() will be executed when the game starts.
To print something in the console you use the method print as you can see in the game and inside the parenthesis what you want to be printed

Input class

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html
To get input from user u use the Input class
GetMouseButtonDown vs GetMouseButton(the first returns one click the other repeating)

If you want to see what a keyword is ctrl + ' over the keyword
The Update() method runs every frame which depends on the game on how many frames we have 30,50,1000
You can see in the console menu that it has tab collapse. By that it counts the buttons pressed and not make create new lines
Check out how binary search / binary chop works in here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm which is very important in computer science

Chapter 5 Interface

	Adding 2D User Interface Text

To add an image just drag and drop it in assets and by clicking on it you can see in the Inspector up right what type it is as shown in image_type_jpg
To enable 2D mode just click the mode you want in the Scene as shown in choosing_2D_3D.jpg
To insert a text in our scene check insert_item_in_scene.jpg or
insert UI element add_ui_element.jpg
Now we have created a canvas and the canvas renderer as you see in canvas_and_object.jpg
Also top right we have the layers as shown in layers.jpg.
As you see in zoom_level.jpg we have high zoom
You click the scene and then with mouse scroll you channge the zoom level
Also you can double click on the word Text below Canvas or double clik on the canvas will go in all canvas
A canvas is where something is drawn in our case our entire game
You can drag and drop the item inside the canvas wherever you want
To change the background color of the canvas select the Main Camera and choose background color you want
Don't forget permanet changes should be made outside the play/tint mode
To center item check center_item.jpg
To change color in text item go to inspector and choose the color you want
To add a script in a UI element see add_script_ui_element_.jpg
To access text programatically we need to drag and drop Text in Inspector as shown in access_text.jpg
To add image go to GameObject  -> Ui - > Image as shown in add_image.jpg(dont't forget to add the image in Canvas Renderer as you did in access_text)

	Frame by frame play

If you want to see your scene running frame by frame first press pause and then play.

	Word Wrapping and Joining strings

To have text fill the whole area you have wrap or overflow option as seen in word_wrapping.jpg
To join strings which called concatenation you use the + in C# and \n to break line

	Changing Resolution

To change resolution go at Game -> Free aspect as in changing_resolution.jpg
If you drag and drop the Game window you will see how it looks with the resolution you picked as shown in dragged_game_window.jpg



	Prepare the game for publishing

First we need to change our build settings by going in File -> Build settings
Then we drag and drop our scene and at player settings we put the resolution we want and the background


	Unity 5 and WebGL
Unity 5 and above supports easy deployment with WebGL
Check unity_webgl.jpg
Don't forget the resolutions at plaeys setting to be same as the canvas you created

	Multiple text dynamically
If you have text that values change from script first you must create the fields as shown in multiple_text_fields.jpg
Then you must assign them to inspector for script by draging and dropping them since they will have appeared to it as shown in multiple_text_in_script.jpg



Chapter 6 Objects and Scenes

	New scenes and levels

Unity has the concept of scenes. We ofter hear the word level in unity.  But they are the same
Imagine you play mario. The levels it has 1 -1 1 -2 etc are levels/scenes
Also you can have scenes for start menu/splash screen or the options menu
Remeber to create a New scene go to File-> New Scene and then Save Scene

	Canvas

Also it has a render mode which is how the canvas is rendered in our scene
As you see in canvas.jpg we have some properties like Screen Space – Overlay, Screen Space – Camera, World Space
With Screen Space – Overlay means that the canvas is what is rendered first in scene
You can anchor an element as you see in text_anchoring.jpg
You can resize the ui by having pressed the u mode as shown in ui_mode.jpg
Holding Alt key whilce resizing the element it will scale more smoothly
Also we have the event system which handles all the events that will be thrown by the UI and triggers the handlers. For example in tablet will automatically check touch events
Canvas isn't needed if you will have collisions etc and you fit everything according to background

	Note : To have the ui element work make sure you have an event system as shown in event_system.jpg

	Change Text to a Component

As you can see in change_to_component.jpg you can change any component to something else
To remove it check remove_component.jpg
Also we can connect a script to a text as shown in script_to_text.jpg


	Change Colors in Button Hovering

You can check button_color_change.jpg


Calling script from button

We can call a specific script for a button as shown in script_from_button.jpg
When you crerate a new object that have scripts on it you just set its positions to 0
To add a script to a component check script_to_component.jpg
Also we drag and drop the script as shown in script_to_click.jpg and we must choose what function we will run (don't forget to have public the function you want to run)

	Application.LoadLevel()

Application.LoadLevel() requires one parameter that is the actual level which will load
or we can have an index
Unity must know that a level is ready so we don't get an error as shown in scenes_in_building.jpg
The first in order will be the first run as shown in scenes_order.jpg
You can copy the empty object and paste it in the scene you want
We have Application.loadedLevel also that returns current level according to order placed in Build Settings

	Application.Quit()
Application.Quit() quits the game but NOT if you run it in a browser or in the Debug Unity mode
Also in mobile platforms it will NOT work and the app will be rejected

	Z-depth

Unity is always 3D even when switched to 2D
The Z-position of sprites matters for rendering
Sprites further from the camera get rendered first
See z-position.jpg
Imagine it what goes on top. The bakground has z = 0. So an object must be in front of the background. Make it z = 5 for example.
If you change the camera to 3D you will see in what order the objects appear

	Sprite

To add a sprite just drag and drop it into your scene and you will see it will create an object as seen object_from_sprite.jpg

Instances and Objects

The objects in the left in the editor are unique and are like having new instances for each object
They have different properties and you can apply to each of them different scripts
Also you can change values specific to that object if they have a script with public fields/methods as in private_vc_public_editor.jpg


Chapter 7 Game Design Document

A game design document is a tool to communicate between members of your team(Artists, Developers, Designers)
It's also a place that's we going to record decisions made before and during development. What's In? What's Out? With this someone will not get cocky and say why we don't add this since we said it would be out
The GDD is a living document that changes all the time according to what you learn, what happens in progress
It's not a plan
Our Number Wizrd UI game has a simple GDD as you can see



Finally we connect the scenes so they follow our GDD. That's why we should go look back and back again at our Game Design Development
Before starting to put a lot of stuff and code to your scenes check with simple buttons that you can move between the corscale scenes as supposed to

	If we structure our game properly then adding functionality will be possible even though we 	have created multiple levels

Chapter 8 Packages

To create a package go to Assets -> Export Package and you choose what you want to export
and you save it where you want
A common exporting is menus, level manager etc
To import it to a project you want you go Assets -> Import Package

TO ADD : Unity Packages from steore what they are and how they work

Chapter 9 Fonts and Music/Sounds

Addings Fonts

To add fonts drag and drop them  in your Assets folder and the folder in it
To change fonts choose the object you want the font and check change_fonts.jpg

	Adding Music

Music and sounds improves quality of a game by a big percentage since hearing is one our most improtant senses
To add your music create an empty object as shown in create_music_object.jpg
Then you drag and drop the audio file to the object you created and you will have something like audio_to_object.jpg
Then click to the inspector and reset the position for the MusicPlayer so it can be down left corner since it s a game object that doesn;t have physical meaning for the game

	Adding Music/Sound to object

To add sound to an object you add an Audio Source component then you drag and drop the clip you need that you have in your folders in editor

	audio.Play()

This has been deprecated and can't be used in new Unity use:

	GetComponent<AudioSource>().Play()

	private void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
    	{
        	if (gameStarted)
       	{
            	   GetComponent<AudioSource>().Play();
        	}

    	}

	We also have to add component Audio source at the editor as shown in 	audio_source_component.jpg

The correct way is to use AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint:

	 AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint()

First create the object Audioclip

	public AudioClip crack;

Then you add it as  parameter :

private void OnCollisionExit2D(Collision2D collision)
    	{
        AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(crack, transform.position);

    	}



	GameObject.DontDestroyOnLoad()

First create the script that will handle the music by going to Add Component and then New script and name the same with your Audio Object
As we see in gameObject.jpg gameObject is the first object in our hierarchy with all its components inspector etc

	Singleton

Singleton is a pattern that you allow to a class to be instantiated only once. Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Singleton
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650316.aspx
http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/singleton.html



class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        SiteStructure s = SiteStructure.Instance;
    }
}

public sealed class SiteStructure
{
    static readonly SiteStructure _instance = new SiteStructure();
    public static SiteStructure Instance
    {
        get
        {
            return _instance;
        }
    }
    SiteStructure()
    {
        // Initialize.
    }
}

	//Or from microsoft
using System;

	public class Singleton
	{
		private static Singleton instance;

		private Singleton() {}

public static Singleton Instance
{
   get
   {
      if (instance == null)
         instance = new Singleton();

	return instance;
    }
 }
	 }

	Destroy()
It is used to remove a gameObject, a component or an asset
	if (instance != null)
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            print("Duplicate music player self-destructing");
        }

Chapter 10 Unity script order execution

	Check this nice article on how unity handles order in scripts functions etc :

	https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html

As you see in method_call_order.jpg the scripts are called and we have mor time for next script more time for next script etc
Awake() runs before Start() as you see in the documents

We don't know what order scripts are executed but in unity we have Script Execution Order as shown in script_execution_order.jpg and we can control ONLY the classes executed
Script execution order is very important since sometimes some things will not behave normally


GetInstanceID()
Returns the instance id of the object.
The instance id of an object is always guaranteed to be unique.

Chapter 11 Using space and resolutions

Orthographic vs Perspective
As you see in inspector for Camera we have an option called projection
An orthographic camera doesn't take account of how far away an object is from it, at all whereas a repsective camera does
Make sure the camera has lower z depth value than the object so you can see it
World Units/Play space total
Move the camera for the object from left to right to see how many world units is as shown in world_units.jpg and subsctract the – position with + position
Sprite Editor
To enter Sprite Editor mode pick the image and then click sprite editor as show in sprite_editor.jpg and change pivot to bottom left so it will fit exactly at the frame in bottom left
Aspect Ratio
Aspect ratio is important since it's the analogy that the scene will scale
Best use aspect ratio than fixed resolution since fixed resolution will not  let all people play your game
https://forum.unity.com/threads/standard-screen-resolution-for-pc-mac-game.292586/

Camera size
Camera has a Size property which means how many world units is from the center to the top of the camera as you can see in camera_size.jpg

Pixels per unit
They have to do with physics etc so you have to be accurate
The bigger the number the smaller the sprite becomes

Chapter 12 Move and interact with objects
Rigidbody 2D
Rigidbodies enable your GameObjects to act under the control of physics. The Rigidbody can receive forces and torque to make your objects move in a realistic way
To move a 2D object you have to add a component of physics that's called Rigidbody_2D
You can see in Rigidbody_2D.jpg how it will look if you add it correctly
Rigidbody 2D Gravity scale
We have an option in Rigidbody 2D called gravity scale
This affects how strong gravity is and how it will pull the object
rigidbody2D.velocity
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D-velocity.html
The velocity of a rigidbody2D
Collider
An object needs to have a psysical body so it can interact with other objects
So you add a collider from Physics 2D as shown in colliders.jpg
A trigger ignores physics engines and when we click IsTrigger it will actually ignore them. If IsTrigger is clicked in either one the two colliding objects physics will be ignored
Colliders work by hitting other colliders
To zoom and see the collider double click on it. To change the size see collider_size.jpg though unity perfectly fits the collider to shape
They have options for size and some other things as you see in colliders_options.jpg
If you untick the IsTrigger we have a collision else a trigger which means something will happen
Static : if it has a collider but NO rigidbody
Rigidbody : Has a Rigidbody
Kinematic : as shown in kinematic.jpg  you have to move it
IF it's going to move during the game add rigidbody on it.Avoid moving static colliders
As shown in colliders_table.jpg we can see according what we want what collider to create. For example if we want to move the object it WON'T  be static and will have a Kinematic RigidBody Collider
If a Rigidbody has mass it will drop cause of gravity. You change it as shown in collider_mass.jpg from dynamic to kinetic. If two objects have mass and hit each other the one with the bigger will take with it the other.
Offset for collider and pivot
You can set where the pivot starts from offset as shown in offset_pivot.jpg
Distance between two objects
To calculate the distance between two objects you simply substract the objects transform position with the object you want the distance to calcaulated
public Paddle paddle;

    	//Distance between ball and paddle
    	private Vector3 paddleToBallVector;

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
        paddleToBallVector = this.transform.position - paddle.transform.position;
        print(paddleToBallVector);
    	}

Message passing
Two game object with colliders meet
Engine sends a message to the objects
We intercept this message in our script
Our script decides what to do next
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html
When collsions are happening physics is calculated
Collision detection
void OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D collision)
Triggers
void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collider)
Scripts
To add a script first you creaqte an object from the class as shown in create_object_from_class.jpg
Then you connect the script/class to the component as shown in script_to_component2.jpg
Don't forget to add the scene to build else you will see an error
If we have a private variable it is not shown in our editor here private_vs_public_editor.jpg
If we have a public bool variable it show in editor with a click option which clicking it will make it true
Physics
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-PhysicMaterial.html
The Physics Material is used to adjust friction and bouncing effects of colliding objects
To create it if you are in 2D you will need a Physics2D Material as show in physics_material_2d.jpg
Physics2D Material has two properties Friction and Bounciness as shown in friction_and_bounciness.jpg
Bounciness 1 means it doesn't lose energy while bouncing
To connect the physics with the collider check physics_to_collider.jpg
Changing project physics
As shown in project_physics.jpg
Those settings affets the whole project so they all behave the same
Snap to grid
We can move objects around in the scene freely
To limit the movement and make it more precise we can have Snap to Grid settings as shown in snap_settings.jpg
Then select the objects you want to apply the snap grid movement
To make it work you should hold Ctrl
Don't forget you have to be in move mode upleft at he icons for the object
GameObject Movement by Mouse
Input.MousePosition.x
void Update () {
        print(Input.mousePosition.x);

	}

	You see with the above script that moving the mouse shows us the exact position at x 	coordinate

	//We will get a number between 0 to 1 whatever the screen size is
	//If the screen width is 1500 and we have the mouse full right 1500/1500 = 1
	print(Input.mousePosition.x/Screen.width);

	See mouse_coordinates.jpg. The 1 means that the mouse is exactly at end right of screen.

	If we multiply it with the total blocks the scene has in x coordinates the mouse position will 	be in game units

	print(Input.mousePosition.x/Screen.width * 20);



Screen.width
	Shows the exact screen width

this.transform.position
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-position.html
To use it you have to build first a Vector3 object
Vector3 paddlePos = new Vector3(0.5f, 0f, 0f);
this.transform.position = paddlePos;
As shown in vector3.jpg the current object which the script belongs, gets immediately to the postion of the Vector we created
Mathf.Clamp to constrain
We use this to limit a number between min and max value
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Clamp.html
Clamps a value between a minimum float and maximum float value.
Vector3
	https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.html

Tags
We can assing tags to objects
Tags are boolable values that you can control
So if we name a tag Breakable and assing it the code will look:
bool isBreakable = (tag == "Breakable");



Chapter 13 Shortcuts
To change between scene and game in the editor Ctrl + 1, Ctrl + 2
Ctrl + P Play again you stop it
Ctrl + S Save scene

Destroy()
Removes a gameobject, component or asset
We have to destroy gameObject which is the gameObject the script is attached to
If something is destroyed and for example in Arkanoid the ball continues we should use OnCollisionExit instead of OnCollisionEnter



Chapter 14 GameObject class
	GameObject.GetComponent
This is a very important class that you access directly the component you want
In the below example we access directly the Rigidbody2D's velocity of current object
this.GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>().velocity = new Vector2(2f,10f);

GameObject.FindObjectOfType
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.FindObjectOfType.html
Connecting object with class programmaticaly so we don't have to associate it with the editor
private Paddle paddle;
	void Start () {


		paddle = GameObject.FindObjectOfType<Paddle>();
		paddleToBallVector = this.transform.position - 			   		paddle.transform.position;

    	}

It works like using the new keyword

Chapter 15 Prefabs
Prefab is a collection of predefined GameObjects & Components that are reusabe throughout your game
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/InstantiatingPrefabs.html
An example is the paddle as shown in paddle.jpg that has many components and we can reuse it
To create a prefab you drag and drop the object from the left to the folder
First you should create a duplicate and NOT use the original and we will have a prefab created as shown in prefab_creation.jpg
If you make a change to the object left you should hit Apply so changes take place in the prefab also
If we make a change to the prefab and not the instance it s immediately applied so if we drag and drop new they will be the same as the prefab and all the instances will be changed
Revert changes back to the prefab settings
Different prefabs can have different scripts or properties values
You should prefab everything os if you make changes to something it will pappy to all in next scenes etc
	Linking prefabs programmaticaly
Chapter 16 Sprites
Sprite Sheets
A sprite sheet is a set of images that are related for various states of the sprite
You can see single_sprites.jpg
When we select sprite we select the thing in the drawer
In unity we can use Multiple sprites as show in mutliple_sprites.jpg and you chop them accordingly at sprite editor. In splice option top left because we left a space around the automatic splice will work.Clicking on each image you ll see they have been recognized as in different_sprites_spliced.jpg. Name them as you want and apply.
Then we choose the sprite we want as shown in multiple_sprites_select.jpg
We store our sprites in an array and then bring them
As shown in sprites_array_programmaticallly.jpg we can determine the size this object will have for the array in the editor
As main sprite we must have it in our editor and not from code from the array
Then we tell what sprite to load as shown to sprite_renderer.jpg
 int spriteIndex = 0;

  //Find component sprite renderer and change it according to index
  this.GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>().sprite = hitSprites[spriteIndex];





Affordance
We want the player to know what to do next
Multi hit blocks must show progress
Player will know that hitting them shows progress
